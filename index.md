## Welcome! 

We built this site to help students in Boston learn more about startups. 

We’re hoping that with easier access to resources and various tools, more students will be interested in the Boston startup scene. We’ve included a bunch of links and recommendations, and also included a directory to student groups on a bunch of campuses.

This is just a starting point. We’d love to know if you have anything to add. Feel free to contact us and let us know what we’re missing and how we can improve the page. 

Happy browsing,
