## Welcome! 

We built this site to help students in Boston learn more about startups. 

We found ourselves recommending the same places to start, blogs to read, people to follow, and sites to read to most of the people we met interested in getting into startups, so we thought it was time to put them in one place. Click one of the links on the left to find what we think are the best resources in that area.

This is just a starting point. We’d love to know if you have anything to [add](/contribute). Feel free to contact us and let us know what we’re missing and how we can improve the page. 

Happy browsing,
